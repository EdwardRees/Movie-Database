Design, Load, and Explore a Movies Database

## Code info

https://github.com/EdwardRees/Movie-Database/blob/main/erees-code-phase3.sql

Run the SQL code with the command:

`psql moviesdb < erees-code-phase3.sql`

This will run all of the queries for each problem. This does assume that the moviesdb_dump_file has already been run. If that hasn't, then `psql moviesdb < moviesdb_dump_file` must be run beforehand.
